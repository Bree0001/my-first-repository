      <h1>Coding Chronicles: From Uni Dropout to Tech Wizard</h1>

    <p>
      Once upon a time in the land of academia, I found myself face-to-face with
      the daunting reality that university wasn't quite the perfect fit for me.
      The lecture halls felt like mazes, and every minute spent in the school
      compound drained my soul. The only thing I ever felt like made sense for
      me in uni was hanging out with my friends. If you’ve been to CUEA, you
      definitely know the good old Bogani Thursdays and then hit 1824 thereafter
      or westmall for some fire pork.

      Amidst the chaos of dropping out, enters a silver-lining, my
      <em>ex-boyfriend</em>, who is as tech-savvy as a robot but has a heart
      that sometimes needs a reboot. He convinces me that coding is the key to
      unlocking a world of possibilities, a digital Narnia, if you will. Little
      did I know that my journey into the tech realm will become both my escape
      and my comedic adventure.

      After our breakup, my heart was shattered into more pieces than a jigsaw
      puzzle in a tornado. I wallowed in self-pity, and spent the better part of
      Jamuhuri day <i>(this was two days after the break-up)</i> crying. But
      then I remembered the wise words of a software update:
      <strong><i> life goes on</i></strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the post-breakup era, I found solace in the comforting glow of my
      computer screen, where coding became my therapy and debugging my
      catharsis. I began to see the humor in my coding adventures, like the time
      I accidentally created a program that thinks 2 + 2 equals fish. Classic
      mix-up, really.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I embrace my newfound passion, I realize that my journey is just
      beginning. The thrill of discovery and the promise of a future filled with
      possibilities fuel my enthusiasm. Sure, I'm still in the shallow end of
      coding, splashing around like a penguin trying to swim, but the deep
      waters of algorithms and data structures are beckoning me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the breakup, I found myself adrift in the vast ocean of the tech
      world, with no familiar faces in sight. My only companions were YouTube
      tutorials, Udemy courses, and the reliable W3Schools. It was a lonely
      journey, but the virtual mentors on the screen became my guiding lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, I stumbled upon a tech mentor who saw potential in my coding
      endeavors. He encouraged me to post my first repository, but my imposter
      syndrome kicked in, and I declined. I insisted that my first code was
      nothing short of mediocre, but he wisely mentioned that everyone starts
      from somewhere. Undeterred, he continued to push me, like a digital Yoda
      guiding a fledgling Jedi through the coding galaxy. I promised him to make
      something better and push it to github and alas, here we are!.
    </p>
    <p>
      So yeah, that's just the overview of a dropout turned coder, fueled by
      Fanta, armed with a keyboard, and ready to conquer the tech universe one
      goofy line of code at a time. The future is uncertain, but it's also a
      canvas waiting for my algorithmic brushstrokes. And as I type away, I
      can't help but wonder what other absurd and delightful surprises the tech
      world has in store for me.

      As we delved into the realm of programming, our relationship started
      resembling a spaghetti code – messy, convoluted, and filled with
      unexpected bugs. One day, he throws an error message at me that read,
      "It's not you; it's me," and that's when I knew the relationship was ready
      for a force quit.

    <p>Wait, where are my manners? I forgot to introduce myself.</p>
